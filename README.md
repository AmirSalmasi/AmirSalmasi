### Hi there 👋

**AmirSalmasi/AmirSalmasi** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a dynamic machine learning programmer and engineer, always looking to take on big projects👌🏻

With over a year of experience working on supervised and unsupervised projects, I also teach decision tree and random forest algorithms, working with numpy and pandas libraries, and data preprocessing techniques to individuals in the field of machine learning

My expertise is data analysis and programming in the field of machine learning and I am always looking for opportunities to apply my experience in different fields.

Because I enjoy solving problems, I always try to be up-to-date and work with new and creative tools.
