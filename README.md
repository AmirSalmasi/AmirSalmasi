### Hi , I'm Amir Salmasi 👋

__I'm a dynamic machine learning programmer and engineer, always looking to take on big projects👌🏻__

With over a year of experience working on **supervised and unsupervised projects**, **I also teach decision tree and random forest algorithms, working with numpy and pandas libraries, and data preprocessing techniques to individuals in the field of machine learning**

My expertise is data analysis and programming in the field of machine learning and I am always looking for opportunities to apply my experience in different fields.

Because I enjoy solving problems, I always try to be up to date and work with new and creative tools😎
